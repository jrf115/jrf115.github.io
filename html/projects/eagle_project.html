        <div class="col-xl-6 m-auto p-3" style="font-size:18px"> My Eagle Project was a landscaping project that involved the removal of dirt and shrubs, and replacing it with gravel for the parking lot at the Grace Church Bath Campus Offices on Cleveland Massillon Road. There were two parking lot islands that needed this change, and there was a dirt bed on the north side of the lot that had bushes needing to be removed. This removal was needed because it would minimize the maintenance required and would help keep the parking lot looking pleasant (Attendance to weeds and resupplying the islands after annual snow plowing would not be necesarry with gravel). I measured the volume of the islands to calculate how much gravel they would need. The islands each needed to have about two inches of dirt removed and then filled with gravel. I ordered six Blue Hawk tarps to be placed under the gravel, which would prevent weeds from sprouting through the gravel, and 5.9 tons of #57 stone to be filled into the islands. I gave fliers to my troop that gave the project description, when and where it was happening, what to bring, and how to RSVP. I needed to communicate with my project beneficiary numerous times regarding on how the project was going to be shaped out, figuring out dates, and to setup a partion of the parking lot for the transfer truck to dump the ordered gravel. </div>
        <div class="col-xl-6 m-auto p-3" style="font-size:18px"> On the day of the project we started off with me giving a safety briefing, which discussed where we were allowed to work in, how to properly use tools, how to avoid dehydration, being aware of how safety vehicles would enter the property if necessary, where the first aid kit would be, and checking everyone had gloves, sturdy shoes, and long pants if possible. The phases for the day then as follows: Dig and pull out roots, shrubbery, bushes and plants from the islands and dirt bed. Then dig out two inches deep of dirt. Wheel barrows are used to transport the dirt and plants into the forest behind the parking lot. After enough of the dirt has been removed, the tarp needs to be sized and cut to fit into the islands for the gravel to lay on top of. Finally, the gravel could be transported using wheel barrows and spread out both islands. We started at 8:00 a.m., aiming to spend no longer than eight hours for the day, and finished before 2:30 p.m. I guided my team of volunteers through the phases, made sure they were capable of handling their workloads, helped keep them motivated, and reminded them to take breaks and drink fluids. A total of 25 people, including me, helped out with the landscaping, and put out a cumulative total of 97 work hours. The total conversation hours, including with my project beneficiary, scoutmaster and council leader was 31.38 hours. </div>
